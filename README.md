## **Machine Learning Projects Overview**

This repository contains three machine learning projects that aim to provide hands-on experience with real-world datasets. Each project addresses a different machine learning task, ranging from binary classification and regression to multiclass classification. By working through these projects, you’ll get familiar with essential techniques like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

### **1. Titanic Survival Prediction**

**Objective**:  
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived or not. This is one of the most classic beginner projects in data science and machine learning.

**Dataset Features**:  
The Titanic dataset includes various features about the passengers, such as:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, and whether the passenger was traveling alone.
- **Ticket Details**: Class of the ticket (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class), the fare they paid, and cabin number.
- **Outcome**: Whether the passenger survived or not (target variable).

**Key Steps**:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Begin by exploring relationships in the data, such as how the survival rate differs by gender, class, and age.
- **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values (for example, age or cabin), encode categorical variables like gender and embarkation port, and normalize numerical values.
- **Model Building**: Use classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict survival based on the available features.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to understand how well the model can classify passengers' survival status.

### **2. Movie Rating Prediction**

**Objective**:  
In this project, the task is to predict a movie's rating based on its features, such as genre, director, and cast. This is a regression problem, as you will predict a continuous value (the rating) instead of a category (like survival or flower species).

**Dataset Features**:  
The movie dataset typically includes the following:
- **Movie Attributes**: Genre (action, drama, etc.), director, cast (leading actors), budget, and year of release.
- **Target Variable**: Movie ratings, which could be from critics or user reviews, presented as numerical values (e.g., between 1 and 10).

**Key Steps**:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze how different features like genre or budget relate to the movie's rating. For example, do higher-budget movies tend to have higher ratings?
- **Data Preprocessing**: Deal with missing data, encode categorical features (e.g., director, genre) and scale numerical features (e.g., budget, year).
- **Model Development**: Apply regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, to predict movie ratings.
- **Evaluation**: Use evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score to measure model performance and improve predictions.

### **3. Iris Flower Classification**

**Objective**:  
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning, and this project involves classifying flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on sepal and petal dimensions. This is a multiclass classification problem.

**Dataset Features**:  
The Iris dataset includes the following measurements for each flower:
- **Sepal Length** and **Sepal Width**: The size of the sepals (the outer petals of the flower).
- **Petal Length** and **Petal Width**: The size of the inner petals.
- **Target Variable**: The species of the flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).

**Key Steps**:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the relationships between petal and sepal sizes for each species using scatter plots and pair plots.
- **Model Building**: Train classification models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict the flower species.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models based on accuracy and confusion matrices to see how well the model performs in classifying each species.

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
   - Transforming and cleaning data to make it suitable for machine learning models.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
   - Selecting the most important features and reducing dimensionality.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Implementing different types of machine learning algorithms such as classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, KNN) and regression (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor).
   - Fine-tuning models and using techniques like cross-validation to prevent overfitting.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Using various evaluation metrics based on the type of problem (classification or regression).
   - Understanding and interpreting model performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### **Required Libraries**:

For all three projects, the following Python libraries are used:
- `pandas` for data manipulation and cleaning.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- `scikit-learn` for building and evaluating machine learning models.

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

These three projects provide hands-on practice with real-world datasets, offering valuable insights into machine learning workflows. Whether you're building a survival predictor, estimating movie ratings, or classifying flowers, these tasks will give you a comprehensive understanding of how machine learning models work and how to improve them using real data.
